## Overview
This project was a bit more interesting than the previous Frontend Mentor challenges I did. It felt complex at first, but once I started building, things came together pretty smoothly and it ended up being a fun experience overall.

### The challenge
Users should be able to:

- Complete the form with their details
- Receive form validation messages if:
  - Any field is missed
  - The email address is not formatted correctly
  - The avatar upload is too big or the wrong image format
- Complete the form only using their keyboard
- Have inputs, form field hints, and error messages announced on their screen reader
- See the generated conference ticket when they successfully submit the form
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

## My process
Since I didnâ€™t have the Figma file for this challenge, I tried something new: I brought the design images into Figma and manually measured the font sizes, spacing, and element dimensions. I then used those measurements to build the CSS design system and utility classes.

The HTML structure was fairly simple to set up. After that, I built the components one by one. Finally, I handled responsiveness, going back and forth as needed. I used clamp() for font sizes and letter spacing, and only used media queries for the body backgrounds and ticket sizing.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Vanilla JS

### What I learned
Setting up the code to handle the form and the file input was new to me, I learned a lot about file input and forms and the way they should be handled and validated.
